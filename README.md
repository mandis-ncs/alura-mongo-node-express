# Node.js REST API Project

This project is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It follows best practices for creating scalable and maintainable web applications. The API allows you to perform CRUD operations on resources like books and authors, and it demonstrates how to connect a Node.js application to a MongoDB database.

## Features

- **RESTful API Design**: Follows REST architectural style for creating scalable and intuitive APIs.
- **Express Framework**: Utilizes Express.js for building robust and efficient server-side applications.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Connects to a MongoDB database for persistent data storage.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for resources.
- **Advanced Search**: Supports searching for specific fields using query parameters.
- **Relational Data**: Demonstrates how to handle relationships between collections (e.g., books and authors).

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to simplify API development.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing and managing data.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js to interact with the database.
- **Postman**: Tool for testing API endpoints during development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (or a MongoDB Atlas account for cloud-based database)
- Postman (optional, for testing endpoints)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-rest-api.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nodejs-rest-api
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Set up your environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
2. Add your MongoDB connection string:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### Running the Application

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

### Books

- **GET /books**: Retrieve a list of all books.
- **GET /books/:id**: Retrieve a specific book by ID.
- **POST /books**: Create a new book.
- **PUT /books/:id**: Update an existing book by ID.
- **DELETE /books/:id**: Delete a book by ID.

### Authors

- **GET /authors**: Retrieve a list of all authors.
- **GET /authors/:id**: Retrieve a specific author by ID.
- **POST /authors**: Create a new author.
- **PUT /authors/:id**: Update an existing author by ID.
- **DELETE /authors/:id**: Delete an author by ID.

### Advanced Search

- **GET /books?title=example**: Search for books by title.
- **GET /authors?name=example**: Search for authors by name.
